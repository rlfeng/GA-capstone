# Capstone Project: Social media sentiment analysis [Case study: Samsung, Apple and Huawei]

## Problem Statement
Today's marketers are obsessed with sales figures. It is easy to overlook customers' feelings and emotions, which can be hard to quantify. However, consider that emotions are the number one factor in making purchasing decisions. With so many consumers sharing their thoughts and feelings on social media, it quite literally pays for brands to have a pulse on how their products make people feel.

Sentiment analysis is the process of retrieving information about a consumerâ€™s perception of a product, service or brand. We wish to distribute the real-time sentiment data to internal marketing and strategy departments for their further analysis and peruse of the data for strategy development. 

In this project, the social media sentiment analysis is performed on three brands - Samsung, Apple and Huawei. We will be monitoring the comments made on these brands on several platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Reddit.
